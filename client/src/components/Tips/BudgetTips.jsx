                  <h3>1. Come up with a plan</h3>
                  Travelling spontaneously is great, if you have the luxury of
                  time and money to spare. But if you’re travelling on a budget,
                  the first thing to do is come up with a plan. You don’t have
                  need a tight, hour-by-hour itinerary, but you should at least
                  have an idea of how long you’ll be spending in each city or
                  country, and know the route that your epic adventure will
                  take. Leaving less to chance means less unexpected spends;
                  last-minute flights and accommodation are often far more
                  expensive.

                  <h3>3. Be accommodation-savvy</h3> Trade expensive hotel
                  suites for dorm rooms in hostels. Sharing a room naturally
                  divides the costs and communal bunk rooms offer the
                  opportunity to meet people who might be keen to explore with
                  you. Other great alternatives are websites like AirBnB and
                  Couchsurfing, where you simply book a spare room in a local
                  person’s house or apartment. It’ll halve the price and allow
                  you an authentic snapshot of real life in the city. Consider
                  your host your very own, personal tour guide, filled with
                  insider-tips for the best eateries and tourist spots in that
                  neighbourhood.

                  <h3> 5. Book flights in advance…</h3>
                  Especially return flights; running out of money abroad without
                  a guaranteed ticket home is never ideal. Airlines ‘release’
                  their flight seats up to a year in advance and the closer you
                  get to your departure date, the more the prices increase,
                  especially inthe last month.

                  <h3>7. Embrace public transport </h3>Buses and trains are
                  cheaper than planes. It’s that simple! A journey on an
                  overnight train also mean you have one less night in a hostel
                  to pay for…

                  <h3>2. Travel out of season </h3>Avoid trips during the school
                  holidays, this is when the travel industry hikes up prices to
                  take advantage of families who can only travel during these
                  weeks. Research the best time to visit your intended
                  destination, and then travel just before or after these dates.
                  This is called the ‘shoulder season’, where you’ll still have
                  a great trip but maybe the sun won’t shine quite as brightly
                  (and, on the plus side, it won’t be quite as hot.) Hotels and
                  airlines lower their prices to attract customers during this
                  time.

                  <h3>4. Pack properly </h3>Make sure you bring everything you
                  need so that you don’t have to shop while you’re away (apart
                  from a few souvenirs). No matter where you’re heading, take at
                  least one pair of long jeans, warm hoodie and waterproof
                  jacket for unpredictable weather incidents. For some in-depth
                  advice, check out our ‘Travel like a pro’ guide to packing for

                  <h3>6. Be smart about how you fly</h3> Midweek travel prices
                  are lower as a premium is added to weekend flights and you’ll
                  breeze through shorter queues at airport check-in desks and
                  security. The money you save on cheap seats can be spent on
                  food or accommodation when you arrive. Low-cost, budget
                  airlines are fine for short flights and regularly have cheap
                  deals. If you’re planning a weekend trip try to pack light and
                  use only hand luggage, saving yourself a bit of money on hold

                  <h3>8. Don’t eat away your cash</h3>
                  Cheap lunches can be bought in a supermarket or even a local
                  fresh food market, rather than in an overpriced cafe or
                  restaurant. Aim to wander around before choosing a place to
                  eat dinner too; if you just pick the first restaurant you see
                  you won’t know if you’re overspending.
